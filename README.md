# 3-Histograms-Equalization
Histogram equalization is an image processing technique that enhances an imageâ€™s contrast by redistributing its pixel intensity values across the entire range. This improves visibility, particularly in images with low contrast, by spreading out the most frequent intensity levels, making details in both dark and bright areas more distinguishable.
